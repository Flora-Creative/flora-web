In the small city of Wellington, New Zealand - Flora Creative was founded by sound-artists / software developers Timothy J. Barraclough & Paul Mathews.
What started, in 2016, as a small project to build affordable, simplistic audio effects for iOS has blossomed into a creative endeavour to build boutique,
utilitarian artwork that enriches the lives of musicians, composers, sound designers and audiences around the world.
